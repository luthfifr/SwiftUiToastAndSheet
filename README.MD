# Execution and Data Flow Explanation

## 1. Showing Error in Modal View

### **Execution Flow:**

1. **Button Tap in `ContentView`:**
   - The user taps the `Button` labeled "Throw Error" in `ContentView`.
   - The action associated with the button is triggered: `showError(error: SampleError.operationFailed, guidance: "Operation has failed. Please try again later.")`.

2. **Call to `showError` Environment Value:**
   - The `showError` environment value (which is an instance of `ShowErrorAction`) is accessed from the environment using the `@Environment` property wrapper.
   - The `showError` closure is called with two parameters: 
     - `error: SampleError.operationFailed`
     - `guidance: "Operation has failed. Please try again later."`
   - This triggers the `callAsFunction` method of the `ShowErrorAction` struct.

3. **Execution of `callAsFunction` Method in `ShowErrorAction`:**
   - Inside `ShowErrorAction`, the `callAsFunction` method is called, which in turn calls the `action` closure with the provided `error` and `guidance`.
   - In this case, the `action` closure was set in `ContentViewContainer` to point to the `showError` method, so the `showError` method in `ContentViewContainer` is executed.

4. **Setting `errorWrapper` in `ContentViewContainer`:**
   - Inside the `showError` method in `ContentViewContainer`, the `errorWrapper` state is set to a new instance of `ErrorWrapper`, with the provided `error` and `guidance` as parameters.
   - This triggers SwiftUI's state management to update the view, and since `errorWrapper` is marked with `@State`, any change to it will re-render the view.

5. **Display of Error Sheet:**
   - After setting `errorWrapper`, the `sheet` modifier in `ContentViewContainer` checks if `errorWrapper` is non-nil. Since the `errorWrapper` is now populated, the sheet is presented to the user.
   - The content of the sheet is a `Text` view displaying the `guidance` from the `errorWrapper`, which in this case is `"Operation has failed. Please try again later."`.

### **Data Flow:**

1. **Data Flow from `ContentView` to `ContentViewContainer`:**
   - The `ContentView` accesses the `showError` environment value via `@Environment(\.showError)`.
   - `ContentViewContainer` provides the `ShowErrorAction` closure to the environment using `.environment(\.showError, ShowErrorAction(action: showError))`.

2. **Data Flow via `ShowErrorAction`:**
   - When the button is tapped in `ContentView`, the `showError` closure (stored in the environment) is called with the error and guidance data.
   - This data (the `error` and `guidance`) is passed to the `showError` method in `ContentViewContainer`.

3. **Data Flow from `showError` to `errorWrapper`:**
   - The `showError` method in `ContentViewContainer` takes the `error` and `guidance` and uses them to create an `ErrorWrapper` instance.
   - This instance is assigned to the `errorWrapper` state, which holds the error and guidance.

4. **Data Flow to the Sheet:**
   - The `sheet` modifier in `ContentViewContainer` is bound to the `errorWrapper` state. When `errorWrapper` is set, the sheet is presented.
   - The sheet displays the `guidance` from the `errorWrapper`.

### **Summary:**
- The button tap in `ContentView` triggers the `showError` closure from the environment, which invokes the `showError` method in `ContentViewContainer`.
- The error and guidance are passed to `ContentViewContainer`, where an `ErrorWrapper` is created and stored in the state.
- This causes the sheet to be displayed, showing the error guidance to the user.
